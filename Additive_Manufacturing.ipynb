    "## Machine Learning with Additive Manufacturing\n",
    "\n",
    "Additive manufacturing is the process of building from a computer controlled 3-dimensional printer. The material can be polymer (plastic), ceramic, metallic powder, liquid, or any material that is joined together through deposition, solidification, or fusion. It speeds the development of prototypes by precisely converting a computer aided design (CAD) drawing into a physical device. Additive manufacturing can be either a prototype or scaled up to full product production, but typically for applications that require customization or with low production volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3D print data set of additive manufacturing test conditions is available for Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). PLA can print at lower temperatures of 180°C compared to 250°C for ABS. PLA is more brittle than ABS and is not typically suitable for high strength applications. The data was collected by researchers in the Mechanical Engineering department at Selçuk Üniversitesi on a Ultimaker S5 3D printer. The study focused on how the parameters in a specific 3D printer affects the print quality, accuracy and final part strength. This work is based on the settings and PLA or ABS filaments. Material and strength tests were carried out on a Sincotec GMBH tester capable of pulling 20 kN.\t\n",
